 PROGRESS REPORT 2 - October

PROJECT description and research principles:
	*Portfolio website that has an intuitive and decorative layout (CSS) and an easy-to-use UI via iconography. 

	Iconography - https://www.atlassian.design/foundations/iconography
		a) "Icons should be used in a purposeful manner to maximize comprehension and reduce cognitive load when you need to call attention to a particular action, command, or section." 

		I am using Iconography primarily in my UI design because I want to have the UI be as intuitive as possible by reducing the cognitive load of the UI as much as possible. Icons are also more universal and often are not language/region specific. En example of this can be seen with the usage of Emojis in text messages. 

		b) "As a general rule, icons should be used in combination with meaningful text to support users progressing through the product in an accessible manner."

		I am using text tool tips for the icons to provide further comprehension of the UI. I used tool tips in order to keep the amount of material
		the user initally sees to a minimum to reduce congitive load. By using dynamic tooltips instead of static labels, I can save space in the UI which adheres to a minimalistic approach of UI design. 

 	Minimalism - https://uxplanet.org/lean-and-mean-power-of-minimalism-in-ui-design-5ca37eb32ac8
		"Characteristics of minimalism: 
			Simplicity
			Clarity
			Expressive visual hierarchy
			High attention to proportions and composition
			Functionality of every element
			Big amount of spare space
			High attention ratio to core details
			Typography as a significant design element
			Eliminating non-functional decorative elements"

LANGUAGES used: 
	HTML, CSS, JS

Research and development work hours: 
16hrs

Upcoming:
- Mobile layout compatibility for home page and CAREER page
- My own UI's/websites for each of the other Portfolio links like I did for the MUSIC page.
