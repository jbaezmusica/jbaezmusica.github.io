 PROGRESS REPORT 3 - November

PROJECT description and research principles:
	*Portfolio website that has an intuitive and decorative layout (CSS) and an easy-to-use UI via iconography. 

	Iconography - https://www.atlassian.design/foundations/iconography
		a) "Icons should be used in a purposeful manner to maximize comprehension and reduce cognitive load when you need to call attention to a particular action, command, or section." 

		I am using Iconography primarily in my UI design because I want to have the UI be as intuitive as possible by reducing the cognitive load of the UI as much as possible. Icons are also more universal and often are not language/region specific. En example of this can be seen with the usage of Emojis in text messages. 
 
		b) "As a general rule, icons should be used in combination with meaningful text to support users progressing through the product in an accessible manner."

		I am using text tool tips for the icons to provide further comprehension of the UI. I used tool tips in order to keep the amount of material
		the user initally sees to a minimum to reduce congitive load. By using dynamic tooltips instead of static labels, I can save space in the UI which adheres to a minimalistic approach of UI design. 

 	Minimalism - https://uxplanet.org/lean-and-mean-power-of-minimalism-in-ui-design-5ca37eb32ac8
		"Characteristics of minimalism: 
			Simplicity
			Clarity
			Expressive visual hierarchy
			High attention to proportions and composition
			Functionality of every element
			Big amount of spare space
			High attention ratio to core details
			Typography as a significant design element
			Eliminating non-functional decorative elements"

LANGUAGES used: 
	HTML, CSS, JS

Updated Development: 
1) Created a PHOTO EDITOR website for the PHOTO section of portfolio. 
 - Clean UI with high functionality.
 - Upload image and apply filters and edits using the UI sliders decorated around the image element.
   * UI sliders only appear after image is uploaded, and appear along image perimeter. By doing this, you save UI space and adhere to Minimalism principles. 
 - CLICK on image for download.
   * By clicking on image instead of having a separate download button, you save UI space and adhere to Minimalism principles. 
2)  Created a WORKOUT TRACKER for the HEALTH/FITNESS section of portfolio. (Encourage people to think of health and fitness from a funner perspective)
 - Created website that will allow user to input workouts into the UI.
   * The UI is themed as a video-game platform with level gauges that convey the user's workout progress.
   * The inputted workouts are obtained and stored in the browser's sessionStorage backend via JS
   * Workout log feature allows user to see a log of dated workouts they have input
   * Each UI page for each workout is uniquely themed with CSS and images. Multiple image layers were used on each page to develop a original, unique, and         eye-catching UX.
   * The website contains high functionality while maintaining a clean and minimalistic UI design that is easy to follow, and has a minimal user learning-curve.
